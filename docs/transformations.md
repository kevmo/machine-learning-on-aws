Transformations of predictors (or features) in a dataset are often done to meet the assumptions of a statistical or machine learning model, to improve the model's interpretability, or to create a more powerful representation of the data. Here are some common types of transformations:

1. **Log Transformation**:

   - Used to handle skewed data and to make patterns in the data more interpretable.
   - Commonly used for data that follows a power-law distribution.
   - Example: `log(x)` or `log(x+1)` for datasets with zeros.
2. **Square Root Transformation**:

   - Helps in reducing right-skewed data.
   - Example: `sqrt(x)`
3. **Box-Cox Transformation**:

   - A family of power transformations that aim to stabilize variance and make the data more normal in distribution.
   - The lambda parameter determines the power of the transformation.
4. **Yeo-Johnson Transformation**:

   - Extension of the Box-Cox transformation that can be used for datasets with negative values.
5. **Z-score Standardization (Standard Scaling)**:

   - Transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   - Example: `(x - mean) / std_dev`
6. **Min-Max Scaling**:

   - Scales the data between a specified range (usually 0 to 1).
   - Example: `(x - min) / (max - min)`
7. **Robust Scaling**:

   - Uses the median and the Interquartile Range (IQR) to scale data, making it robust to outliers.
8. **One-Hot Encoding**:

   - Converts categorical variables into a binary matrix representation.
9. **Binning or Quantization**:

   - Converts numerical variables into categorical bins.
10. **Polynomial Features**:

    - Creates new features based on the polynomial combinations of the original features.
11. **Interaction Features**:

    - Represents the interaction between two or more features. For instance, if you have features A and B, an interaction feature would be A*B.
12. **Laplace Smoothing (additive smoothing)**:

    - Primarily used in the context of categorical data and Bayesian methods, it adds a small designated value to eliminate zeros.
13. **Inverse Transformation**:

    - Often used when values are bounded, like rates or proportions.
    - Example: `1/x`
14. **Sigmoid or Logit Transformation**:

    - Maps any input into a value between 0 and 1, often used to transform continuous data into a form suitable for binary classification.
    - Example: `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`

Remember, the appropriateness of a transformation depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis. Before applying any transformation, it's crucial to understand the underlying reasons for its application and its potential impact on the modeling process.
